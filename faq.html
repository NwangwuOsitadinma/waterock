                                Yes, but you must either scrap or hack the wall very wall very well before applying
                                stone.<br /><br />

                                Faster and more appropriate thing is to use chicken gauze attached with concrete
                                nail.(cut the mesh in 1m2 sections and firmly nail unto the wall, the gauze should not
                                overlap and then you rough plaster over it)

                                With the exception of bricks, waterock stones can be installed without plastering.
                                However rough plastering will add strength to your wall (not to your stones)

                                Stones are not meant to shine, they should rather be rustic and some worth dull. However
                                a customer that wishes his or her stones to shine must make sure he uses original
                                breathable sealer as fake ones are more in the market.

                                We rather show pictures or take our potential clients to an existing job or more
                                appropriately have the customer to visit any of our offices ( the reason for this is
                                that over 10m2 no two pieces of stones are the same texture, shape, size, thickness with
                                some colour variance and a few pieces of samples do not tell the story. The irregular
                                combination over a larger surface is why we prefer customers to visit actual jobs in
                                there neigbourhood)

                                time. Just like vitrified tiles, our base colours are worked right through the concrete
                                before applying the top colours.<br />

                                The additives and colours are specially formulated to withstand the harshest weather on

                                Tiles are not very durable on external walls as they stand the chance of falling off

                                walls)<br />

                                Should your tiles fall off in the future or even a few days after installation there is
                                a possibility that you may not find the same type again.

                                Finally the value of your property goes up with any stone installation you have.

                                Yes, but you must either scrap or hack the wall very wall very well before applying
                                stone.<br /><br />

                                Faster and more appropriate thing is to use chicken gauze attached with concrete
                                nail.(cut the mesh in 1m2 sections and firmly nail unto the wall, the gauze should not
                                overlap and then you rough plaster over it)

                                With the exception of bricks, waterock stones can be installed without plastering.
                                However rough plastering will add strength to your wall (not to your stones)

                                Stones are not meant to shine, they should rather be rustic and some worth dull. However
                                a customer that wishes his or her stones to shine must make sure he uses original
                                breathable sealer as fake ones are more in the market.

                                Yes, but you must either scrap or hack the wall very wall very well before applying
                                stone.<br /><br />

                                Faster and more appropriate thing is to use chicken gauze attached with concrete
                                nail.(cut the mesh in 1m2 sections and firmly nail unto the wall, the gauze should not
                                overlap and then you rough plaster over it)

                                With the exception of bricks, waterock stones can be installed without plastering.
                                However rough plastering will add strength to your wall (not to your stones)

                                Stones are not meant to shine, they should rather be rustic and some worth dull. However
                                a customer that wishes his or her stones to shine must make sure he uses original
                                breathable sealer as fake ones are more in the market.

                                that over 10m2 no two pieces of stones are the same texture, shape, size, thickness with
                                some colour variance and a few pieces of samples do not tell the story. The irregular
                                combination over a larger surface is why we prefer customers to visit actual jobs in

                                before applying the top colours.<br />

                                The additives and colours are specially formulated to withstand the harshest weather on

                                Waterock stones look natural (using tiles can be likened to hanging a photocopy or
                                printed copy of your favourite artwork)<br />

                                Tiles are not very durable on external walls as they stand the chance of falling off
                                after sometime (Our stones are made of concrete and bonds well with your cement
                                walls)<br />

                                Should your tiles fall off in the future or even a few days after installation there is
                                a possibility that you may not find the same type again.

                                Finally the value of your property goes up with any stone installation you have.
